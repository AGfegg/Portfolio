<h2>Rules</h2>
											<h2>Time Kills</h2>
<h3>3-6 players <br>ages 16+</h3>	
									</header>
<p>
Famous celebrities are being killed in their prime throughout time. The person behind it stole a time machine and is using it to cause mayhem in the past and present.  You and your team of interdimensional detectives have to figure out who and how they are killing celebrities based on clues and connections between the murders. The goal is to solve the case before they get  through all 5 eras/decades.
</p>
<h2> Set up</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose a moderator. This player will be in charge of choosing who dies and the decades. They will know who and how the victims are are killed. They will also be in charge of distributing the autopsy and motive cards when necessary</li>
<li>Moderator use the moderators guide for further instructions. DO NOT share with your fellow players.Take the profiler report cards, celebrity cards, and autopsy cards away from the other players. Only the moderator has access to the full deck.</li>
<li>Players choose an employee ID. Each "employee" is from a different decade as well as an advantage to be used in that decade only.</li>
<li>read over missing persons sheet and put it where everyone can see it.</li>
<li>2 health trackers</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h2> How to play</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are five rounds. Each round will have at most four killings.</li>
<li>The player gets 40 seconds per "killing" to figure out who is killing and how.</li>
<li>The moderator will distribute the decade cards, celbrity cards, the autopsy cards, and the profilers report. It's your job to figure out how and who is killing the celebrities of the current decade.</li>
<li>The player who figures it out first will recieve solved case files.</li>
<li>If four celebrities are killed before the killer and how is fiured out the moderator will reveal who the killer was and their method.</li>
<li>The objective is to have the most solved case files by the end of the 5th decade.</li>
<br><li>Must say how and who killed the victim at the same time. Answer wrong and you lose a case file. If you have no more case files you are out for that decade</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h3>Solved case files</h3>
<ul>
<li>If solved after 1 killing recieve 4 case files</li>
<li>If solved after 2 killing recieve 3 case files</li>
<li>If solved after 3 killing recieve 2 case files</li>
<li>If solved after 4 killing recieve 1 case files</li>
</ul>
<h2>The cards</h2>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each player has an advantage written on ther Id card</li>
<li>The players can reference the date hired to hired to know which decade their player is from.</li><li> The decade tells you when you can use your advantage. The decade cares will also say which player can use their advantage.</li>
<li>The advantage card can be used by all players but only if the advantage holder choses to use it. If activated the moderator everyone will get extra information about the killer or their method. So use wisely.</li>

</ul></p>
<p><h3>Celebrity Card</h3>
<ul>
<li>The celebrity cards are blue for singers, green cards are for actors. This is vital to solving some cases.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h3>Profiler's report card</h3>
<ul>
<li>These cards hint at who the killer is. So, pay attention to the details and reference the missing persons list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h3>Autopsy report</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hint at how they were killed. These could hint at things like they were poisoned or pushed. There are 7 options so all ways of killing will not be used each games</li>
</ul>
</p> 

<p><h3>Missing persons list</h3>
<ul>
<li>List all the possible killers and descriptions that will help you figure out who is doing the killing in each round.</li>
</ul>
</p>
