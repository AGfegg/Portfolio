                                                                              A first person Escape room game. Exploring the idea that obsession and being stuck in th past can grow into a serious problem. The player is trapped in his uncles basement. The uncle, Zachariah, has become a hermit and a bit of a hoarder. The player will explore the home and see what happens whrn untreated trauma and nostalgia take form in an obsessive hoarding nature.
                                                                                </p>
<p>
The idea was that there was an uncle that had become a hermit and hasnâ€™t left his basement in years. Being down there he wanted to be alone and since his wife kept coming downstairs he created a series of traps and puzzles to mess with anyone who went against his wishes. The player plays as zachariah's nephew who is staying with his aunt. He goes downstairs and has to solve puzzles to get out while reminiscing on some of the memories his uncle kept down there. The point was to explore the human idea of nostalgia and obsessions and the unhealthy coping mechanisms that can form

<h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
<h3>A series of issues in development and how they were solved</h3><br>
<h3>Problem</h3>
                                                                                <p>
The team that created this game were selected to work with each other by our professor. Because of this we were all at different levels interms of understanding and skill when it came to UE5. This meant some people could not commit to the bear minimum of work.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
                                                                                <p>
   After said member told us what they were trying to do we helped them figure out how to code there puzzle based on a more simplified code. Hense the extensive use of the Button and a Door techniques throughout the game.
</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
                                                                                <p>
There is a sspecific order the game has to be played in. Due to the layout being realitic house the player would get confused on what room they were suppsoe to go in next.

</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
We used a mix of ui widgets and audio recordings to instruct the player where they were suppose to go and the purpose of what they were doing.
<!--
<br> Audio Example
<div class= "rightphoto">
<img src="widgets" alt"photo of widget" height=100 width =250 ></div> </p>
<audio src="media/elenorarecording.wav 48000.pek" controls></audio>

 <br><h3>Problem</h3>                                                                                <p>
Given that it was a school assignment there were some unrepsonsive team members making it difficutl to fully plan and develop parts of the game

</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
                                                                                <p>
My solution was since we each had a puzzle and the house was broken up into rooms, we all were repsonisle for our own room. This lessened the overlap and allowed for a clear view of who was doing what and how far along they were. This also allowed for the extreme case of having to scrap the room if need be.
